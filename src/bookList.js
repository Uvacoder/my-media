        review: "This is my favorite of the Parker books by far. Parker and a band of criminals try to rob a whole town. Parker from the start is skeptical but comes aboard. It read's like a French heist film."

        review: "At first it's an interesting read. Then you start to wonder if nay of it's true. But because of the things you know to be true, you wonder how much of it's true. In the end I'd say its mostly true stories of multiple people. Worth the read, but so aren't the Pentagon Paper's."

        review: "A really fun culmination of the arc. Parker get his pals to help him steal from the mob. A nice scene around a racetrack. I would say of the three: The Hunter then The Man With The Getaway Face and lastly The Outfit. "

        review: "The first appearance of the Parker character. The first novel zips partly because the story has been retold a few times. It's the foundation for all the following Parker books. But for me the best versions of this story are Point Blank then  Darwyn Cooks adaptation then this book."

        review: "The story of the greatest team ever. Tells how the team came together and what happened in 1992. A lot of behind the scene tales and how Michael Jordan came out of the Olympics as the sole greatest player. Pairs well with McCallum's Dream Team podcast."
